        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Davis Reifel, I'm currently going into my senior year at Michigan State University.
            I'm in the Broad College of Business pursing a degree in finance with a minor in Information Technology.
            In my free time I love to hangout with friends on a boat or playing poker.
        </p>
        <p>I have been working full time at Koucar management for close to 8 months. Koucar Management is a boutique
            investment/mangement firm focusing within the Metro - Detroit area. With my short time working at Koucar management I have
            worked on developing weibsites, advertising and marketing, and financial modeling.
