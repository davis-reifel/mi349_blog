            <p>Designed for the modern traveler, Cambria Hotel Shelby Township – Detroit offers upscale accommodations 
                in Detroit’s northern suburbs. Guests staying will enjoy modern amenities and locally inspired design 
                features that are smart and elegant, yet comfortable. From the spacious lobby and business center to the 
                indoor heated pool, fitness center and full-service restaurant and bar, you’ll experience the little 
                indulgences that allow you to treat yourself during your stay. The hotel is conveniently located 30 miles 
                north of downtown Detroit in Shelby Charter Township, one of the fastest growing communities in Metro Detroit. 
                While the area is quickly becoming one of the best places to do business, you’ll discover that there is plenty 
                to explore outside the office. Guests are happy to learn the hotel is near Stony Creek Metropark, Packard Proving Grounds, 
                Yates Cider Mill and Macomb Orchard Trail. There’s also easy access to shopping, dining and entertainment at the Somerset
                Collection Mall less than 30 minutes away.
